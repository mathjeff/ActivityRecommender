ActivityRecommender is a Xamarin application.

To build ActivityRecommender:

1. Download the source dependencies. This can be done either via https://github.com/mathjeff/DependencyHandler or by manually putting VisiPlacer, AdaptiveInterpolator, and StatList into the deps/ directory.
2. Install Visual Studio.
3. Install the Xamarin plugin to Visual Studio
4. Open ActRect.sln in Visual Studio.
5. Choose an OS to target:
  a. ActRec.Droid is the usual choice. It's Android!
  b. ActRec.UWP doesn't get tested very much, but at the time of writing, it works too.
  c. ActRec.iOS hasn't been tested yet and probably doesn't work, but it probably wouldn't be very hard to make it work.

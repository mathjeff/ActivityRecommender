ActivityRecommender is a Xamarin application.

To build ActivityRecommender:

1. Download the source dependencies. This can be done either via https://github.com/mathjeff/DependencyHandler or by manually putting VisiPlacer, AdaptiveInterpolator, and StatList into the deps/ directory.
2. Install Visual Studio.
3. Install the Xamarin plugin to Visual Studio
4. Open ActRect.sln in Visual Studio.
5. Select ActRect.Droid as the project, and press Build. Note that ActRec.iOS and ActRect.UWP don't work at the moment (but it probably wouldn't be very hard to make them work).

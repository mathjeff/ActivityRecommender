ActivityRecommender
By Jeff Gaston

The ActivityRecommender was created to answer the question “What should I be doing now?” based on user-provided data. Humans can be both forgetful and irrational; computers are neither.

Step 1: Enter Activities to Choose From
One form of user-input is to enter into the system the name of an activity to be considered in the future. The program will only suggest activities that it has been informed of in this way.
Each activity may also be optionally assigned one or more super categories to which it belongs. For instance, the activity named Frisbee may be an example of the activity named Exercise, which may belong to the activity named Useful. Frisbee may also belong to the activity named Fun.
The program thusly builds an inheritance hierarchy, which allows it to better predict ratings of activities based on similar activities.
Tip: When you are typing an activity name, you’ll notice that there may be a box below what you are typing, containing a suggestion. You may push [tab] or [enter] to automatically fill in what you see there.


Step 2: Type What You’ve Been Doing
The other primary method of user input is to type in the name of an activity that you performed, along with the starting and ending date and time, and optionally a numerical rating indicating the value of having performed this activity compared to having performed the previous activity. For example, if you believe there was twice as much value in your latest participation than in the previous one, then enter the number "2". If you don’t want to enter a rating, just don’t type anything.
Tip: use the buttons below the start-time and end-time boxes to automatically fill the current time into the start or end time.

Step 3: Get Suggestions
After having supplied some data to the program, you may ask for a suggestion by pushing the button labeled “Suggest”. This is the step that you will probably use most often.


Step 4: Export Data
After having used this program for a while, you may want to make a backup of the data that has been entered. Push the button to receive a text file full of data.

   *   Rediscover how to be happy and recharged!

       *   What if you did slightly more of the kinds of things that have made you happy in the past? Want an idea? Ask ActivityRecommender for a suggestion!

   *   No procrastination!

       *   If it thinks working would be good for you, ActivityRecommender will say so.

   *   Encouragement, judgement, and advice!

       *   Whenever you do something, ActivityRecommender makes a carefully chosen remark from among more than 128 choices, including:

           *   "Phenomenal!"

           *   "Oops"

           *   "Not bad, but I don't think you had to do this now"

   *   Measure your efficiency!

       *   If being happy isn't enough for you, ActivityRecommender can also measure how efficiently you accomplish your tasks.

       *   This doesn't require you to estimate how difficult your tasks are. If your measured efficiency changes, it doesn't simply mean that your difficulty estimate was wrong. Now you can truly measure your efficiency rather than measuring difficulty!

       *   Really? How does this work?

           *   If you complete tasks in a random order, then the relationship between when you did the task and how difficult it was is random. Then you can correlate factors like sleeping, eating, and resting against how long it takes you to complete your tasks.

       *   This information gets saved forever. If you are inefficient it will haunt you in your efficiency graph!

   *   Reminisce!

       *   You can browse happy events from the past

   *   Dump ideas now, sort later!

       *   Whenever you have incomplete or non-urgent ideas of things to do, you can write them down, reorder them, and return to them later when you're ready. It's easier than remembering them and leaves you with more brainpower to make more ideas!

   *   No interruptions!

       *   ActivityRecommender doesn't distract you with notifications when you're not using it.

   *   Super fast!

       *   Awesome autocomplete makes it very fast to record what you've done: often as few as 4 button presses!

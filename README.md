ActivityRecommender
By Jeff Gaston

ActivityRecommender is an activity recommendation engine that uses personalized, timestamped data to suggest activities to do and to give the user feedback on their choices.

To run the published version of ActivityRecommender:
   *   Install the [published Android app here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mathjeff.ActRec)
   *   The iOS app mostly works but needs more polishing and isn't published yet.

For an overview of key features, see the in-app documentation at [FeatureOverviewLayout.cs](./ActRec/ActRec/Source/View/FeatureOverviewLayout.cs)

For usage instructions, see the in-app documentation at [InstructionsLayout.cs](./ActRec/ActRec/Source/View/InstructionsLayout.cs)
